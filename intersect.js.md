# intersect.js
Intersect.js is a simple rectangle intersection checker library.
It introduces the `checkIntersection` function, which works as follows:

## engn.checkIntersection (x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2)
Check for the intersection of rectangle 1
(x1 = x, y1 = y, w1 = width, h1 = height) and rectangle 2 (x2 = x, y2 = y, w2 = width, h2 = height).

**Returns:** A boolean value representing whether or not the rectangles intersect.
